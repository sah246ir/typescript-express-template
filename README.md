# TypeScript Express Template

This is a template for building TypeScript projects with Express. It provides a basic structure to kickstart your development process.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sah246ir/typescript-express-template.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd typescript-express-template
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

### Build

To compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript, use:

```bash
npx tsc -b
```

This command will compile the TypeScript files in the `src` directory and output the JavaScript files into the `dist` directory.

### Run Server

Once the project is compiled, you can run the server using:

```bash
node ./dist/index.js
```

This will start the Express server, and it will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` by default.
